    <li>Unless otherwise specified by the company or the job description, submit your resume in pdf format. You can convert this file to pdf in google docs by going to File, select Download, and then pdf.</li>
    <li>Write 2-5 bullet points for each position, depending on the duration and relevance of the position. Keep sections that are less relevant to the job you're applying to short.</li>
    <li>Your most recent position should have the most bullet points, as long as the position is relevant to the one you're applying for.</li>
    <li>Describe your existing role using the present continuous tense and describe past roles using the past simple tense.</li>
